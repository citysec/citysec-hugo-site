      <description>Meeting 1 Recap ðŸŽ‰ We started out by covering some pros &amp;amp; cons for different linux distros. The main ideas were that Ubuntu is a great daily driver while still learning the nuances of linux. Ubuntu allows you to explore the depths of linux while still offering a safe haven to return to when things get scary. ðŸ˜± It may be tempting to jump straight into Arch or Kali linux when practicing web security, but it&amp;rsquo;s more important to use your new favorite OS as your default computer and not as a specialty app that you just need for some wifi cracking.</description>
