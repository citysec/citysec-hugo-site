## what we be about
citySec was formed in the summer of 2018 to provide an ongoing outlet for the growing
cybersecurity demand and presence at [City College](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/engineering/).

citySec is a collective of cybersecurity enthusiasts. :computer:

citySec is for everyone. :busts_in_silhouette:

citySec is fun... :ferris_wheel:

so have fun with it! :tada:
