### The Inaugural Meeting :nerd_face:
We hope you'll join us for our :point_up: 1st meeting on **Wednesday, September 26th at 6:30pm**. We'll announce the meeting location on the [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/citysecnyc/shared_invite/enQtMzk1NTcyMDQxODkwLTY1NmE2MDZkZjJhZWIxNGNmNWVjMjUwNDc3M2I3YmRiYmQ0NDBlMjk0Zjc4MzNhY2JiYjUzMWNmYTE0MjkyYzI)...
<!--more-->

We're gonna start this party by going over linux with the goal of getting everyone a working linux setup, whether that be a virtual machine, bootable USB, or as their daily driver :100:

We'll bring copies of some popular linux distros:

+ [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/)
+ [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/)
+ [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/)

If you're interested in something else, please bring a copy :smile:
