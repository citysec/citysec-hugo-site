### The Inaugural Meeting :nerd_face:
We hope you'll join us for our :point_up: 1st meeting on September 17th. We'll announce where on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/citysecnyc/shared_invite/enQtMzk1NTcyMDQxODkwLTY1NmE2MDZkZjJhZWIxNGNmNWVjMjUwNDc3M2I3YmRiYmQ0NDBlMjk0Zjc4MzNhY2JiYjUzMWNmYTE0MjkyYzI).

We're gonna start this party by going over linux with the goal of getting everyone a working linux setup, whether that be a virtual machine, bootable USB, or as their daily driver :100:

We'll bring copies of some popular linux distros:

+ Ubuntu
+ Kali Linux
+ Arch Linux

If you're interested in something else, please bring a copy :smile:
