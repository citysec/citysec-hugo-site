![big announcement](/img/surprise.gif)

We did a test trial last semester to weigh in on the interest in security. It was mostly during the evenings that we kept our meetings BUT, back by popular demand, we are having our meetings on Thursdays during club hours :tada:
<!--more-->

Join us this Thursday, February 7 @ 12:30 to 1:15 in ST 2M5-2 (Located in the Engineering Building...once you come off the elevator, make a right and come down to the end of the hallway until you enter an office)

Stay tuned on our events page for more meetings, etc.
