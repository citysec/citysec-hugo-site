Sup folks! Springtime is upon us and spring break is basically here. We started a [mailing list](https://protonmail.us20.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=961d81285d786b9d4b77825c2&id=7bbc63dd45). It seems that students aren't visiting the site as often as I thought. Figured it would be more convenient if I brought the content to you guys instead. Make sure to join if you haven't already!

Forgive my absence. Midterms has been breathing down my neck all month. I hope midterms have wrapped nicely for the rest of you guys. I know this is a bit last minute, but we'll be having another meeting tomorrow at ST 2M5-2 from 12:30p - 1:15p

### upcoming events

### projects
+ The [Metasploit](https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/) guide is a perfect [starting point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCPyoWHy4eA) for those who want to learn penetration testing and ethical hacking.

### collaborations
There's a little project with CUNY 2X Tech that we're doing in early May so keep a lookout for that one!

There will be more details added very soon! Make sure to check our [events page](https://citysec.nyc/page/events/). If there's any questions, concerns, etc. bring it up in the slack forum or email us
