Yep! You guessed it...absolutely nothing.

This will be the last post from citysec officially. Unfortunately, I don't have the energy and the time to single-handedly manage the club. However, this site will not be deleted. This site may or may not be found at this domain in the future. It serve as a point of reference for anyone that wants to pursue a career in security. I've already updated the site.

For those that want to revive the club and make it official, I highly recommend that you create a chapter under [The National Cybersecurity Student Association](https://www.cyberstudents.org/) where you'll have a lot more help and a community to running a successful club. Feel free to take any resources from this site to help build your skillset or foundation for future workshops.

Good Luck!
